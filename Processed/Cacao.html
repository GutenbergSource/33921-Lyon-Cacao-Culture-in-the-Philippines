<p class="first"><span class="sc">Sir</span>: I submit herewith an
essay on the cultivation of cacao, for the use of planters in the
Philippines. This essay is prompted first, because much of the cacao
grown here is of such excellent quality as to induce keen rivalry among
buyers to procure it at an advance of quite 50 per cent over the common
export grades of the Java bean, notwithstanding the failure on the part
of the local grower to &ldquo;process&rdquo; or cure the product in any
way; second, because in parts of Mindanao and Negros, despite ill
treatment or no treatment, the plant exhibits a luxuriance of growth
and wealth of productiveness that demonstrates its entire fitness for
those regions and leads us to believe in the successful extension of
its propagation throughout these Islands; and lastly because of the
repeated calls upon the Chief of the Agricultural Bureau for literature
or information bearing upon this important horticultural industry.</p>
<p>The importance of cacao-growing in the Philippines can hardly be
overestimated. Recent statistics place the world&rsquo;s demand for
cacao (exclusive of local consumption) at 200,000,000 pounds, valued at
more than $30,000,000 gold.</p>
<p>There is little danger of overproduction and consequent low prices
for very many years to come. So far as known, the areas where cacao
prospers in the great equatorial zone are small, and the opening and
development of suitable regions has altogether failed to keep pace with
the demand.</p>
<p>The bibliography of cacao is rather limited, and some of the best
publications,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e259src" href="#xd27e259" name=
"xd27e259src">1</a> being in French, are unavailable to many. The
leading English treatise, by Professor Hart,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e262src" href="#xd27e262" name="xd27e262src">2</a> admirable in
many respects, deals mainly with conditions in Trinidad, West Indies,
and is fatally defective, if not misleading, on the all-important
question of pruning.</p>
<p>The life history of the cacao, its botany, chemistry, and statistics
are replete with interest, and will, perhaps, be treated in a future
paper.</p>

<h2 class="super">Cacao Culture in the Philippines.</h2>
<h2 class="main">Introduction.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Cacao in cultivation exists nearly everywhere in the
Archipelago. I have observed it in several provinces of Luzon, in
Mindanao, Jol&oacute;, Basilan, Panay, and Negros, and have
well-verified assurances of its presence in Ceb&uacute;, Bohol, and
Masbate, and it is altogether reasonable to predicate its existence
upon all the larger islands anywhere under an elevation of 1,000 or
possibly 1,200 meters. Nevertheless, in many localities the condition
of the plants is such as not to justify the general extension of cacao
cultivation into all regions. The presence of cacao in a given locality
is an interesting fact, furnishing a useful guide for investigation and
agricultural experimentation, but, as the purpose of this paper is to
deal with cacao growing from a commercial standpoint, it is well to
state that wherever reference is made to the growth, requirements,
habits, or cultural treatment of the plant the commercial aspect is
alone considered. As an illustration, attention is called to the
statement made elsewhere, that &ldquo;cacao exacts a minimum
temperature of 18&deg;&rdquo;; although, as is perfectly well known to
the writer, its fruit has sometimes matured where the recorded
temperatures have fallen as low as 10&deg;. There is much to be learned
here by experimentation, for as yet the cultivation is primitive in the
extreme, pruning of any kind rudimentary or negative, and
&ldquo;treatment&rdquo; of the nut altogether unknown.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in cacao-producing countries its cultivation has long
passed the experimental stage, and the practices that govern the
management of a well-ordered cacao plantation are as clearly defined as
those of an orange grove in Florida or a vineyard in California.</p>
<p>In widely scattered localities the close observer will find many
young trees that in vigor, color, and general health leave nothing to
be desired, but before making final selection for a plantation he
should inspect trees of larger growth for evidences of &ldquo;die
back&rdquo; of the branches. If &ldquo;die back&rdquo; is present,
superficial examination will generally determine if it is caused by
neglect or by the attacks of insects. If not caused by neglect or
insect attacks, he may assume that some primary essential to the
continued and successful cultivation of the tree is wanting and that
the location is unsuited to profitable plantations.</p>
<p>With due regard to these preliminary precautions and a close
oversight of every subsequent operation, there is no reason why the
growing of cacao may not ultimately become one of the most profitable
horticultural enterprises that can engage the attention of planters in
this Archipelago. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e301" href=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Climate.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is customary, when writing of any crop culture, to
give precedence to site and soil, but in the case of cacao these
considerations are of secondary importance, and while none of the minor
operations of planting, pruning, cultivation, and fertilizing may be
overlooked, they are all outweighed by the single
essential&mdash;<i>climate</i>.</p>
<p>In general, a state of atmospheric saturation keeps pace with heavy
rainfall, and for that reason we may successfully look for the highest
relative humidity upon the eastern shores of the Archipelago, where the
rainfall is more uniformly distributed over the whole year, than upon
the west.</p>
<p>There are places where the conditions are so peculiar as to
challenge especial inquiry. We find on the peninsula of Zamboanga a
recorded annual mean rainfall of only 888 mm., and yet cacao
(unirrigated) exhibits exceptional thrift and vigor. It is true that
this rain is so evenly distributed throughout the year that every drop
becomes available, yet the total rainfall is insufficient to account
for the very evident and abundant atmospheric humidity indicated by the
prosperous conditions of the cacao plantations. The explanation of this
phenomenon, as made to me by the Rev. Father Algu&eacute;, of the
Observatory of Manila, is to the effect that strong equatorial ocean
currents constantly prevail against southern Mindanao, and that their
influence extend north nearly to the tenth degree of latitude. These
currents, carrying their moisture-laden atmosphere, would naturally
affect the whole of this narrow neck of land and influence as well some
of the western coast of Mindanao, and probably place it upon the same
favored hygrometric plane as the eastern coast, where the rainfall in
some localities amounts to 4 meters a year.</p>
<p>While 2,000 mm. of mean annual rainfall equably distributed is ample
to achieve complete success, it seems almost impossible to injure cacao
by excessive precipitation. It has been known to successfully tide over
inundation of the whole stem up to the first branches for a period
covering nearly a month.</p>
<p>Irrigation must be resorted to in cases of deficient or unevenly
distributed rainfall, and irrigation is always advantageous whenever
there is suspension of rain for a period of more than fifteen days.</p>
<p>Concerning temperatures the best is that with an annual mean of
26&deg; to 28&deg;, with 20&deg; as the mean minimum where any measure
of success may be expected. A mean temperature of over 30&deg; is
prejudicial to cacao growing.</p>
<p>The last but not least important of the atmospheric phenomena for
our consideration are the winds. Cacao loves to &ldquo;steam and
swelter in its own atmosphere&rdquo; and high winds are inimical, and
even refreshing breezes are incompatible, with the greatest success. As
there are but few large areas in these Islands that are exempt from one
or other of our prevailing winds, the remedies that suggest themselves
are: The selection of small <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e322"
href="#xd27e322" name="xd27e322">7</a>]</span>sheltered valleys where
the prevailing winds are directly cut off by intervening hills or
mountains; the plantation of only small groves in the open, and their
frequent intersection by the plantation of rapid growing trees; and,
best of all, plantings made in forest clearings, where the remaining
forested lands will furnish the needed protection.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="site" class="div1 chapter"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#xd27e149">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Location.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is always desirable to select a site that is
approximately level or with only enough fall to assure easy drainage.
Such sites may be planted symmetrically and are susceptible to the
easiest and most economical application of the many operations
connected with a plantation.</p>
<p>Provided the region is well forested and therefore protected from
sea breezes, the plantation may be carried very near to the coast,
provided the elevation is sufficient to assure the grove immunity from
incursions of tide water, which, however much diluted, will speedily
cause the death of the plants.</p>
<p>Excavations should be made during the dry season to determine that
water does not stand within 1&frac12; meters of the surface, a more
essential condition, however, when planting is made &ldquo;at
stake&rdquo; than when nursery reared trees are planted.</p>
<p>Hillsides, when not too precipitous, frequently offer admirable
shelter and desirable soils, but their use entails a rather more
complicated system of drainage, to carry away storm water without land
washing, and for the ready conversion of the same into irrigating
ditches during the dry season. Further, every operation involved must
be performed by hand labor, and in the selection of such a site the
planter must be largely influenced by the quantity and cost of
available labor.</p>
<p>The unexceptionable shelter, the humidity that prevails, and the
inexhaustible supply of humus that is generally found in deep forest
ravines frequently lead to their planting to cacao where the slope is
even as great as 45&deg;. Such plantations, if done upon a considerable
commercial scale, involve engineering problems and the careful
terracing of each tree, and, except for a dearth of more suitable
locations, is a practice that has little to commend it to the practical
grower.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Soil.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Other things being equal, preference should be given
to a not too tenacious, clayey loam. Selection, in fact, may be quite
successfully made through the process of exclusion, and by eliminating
all soils of a very light and sandy nature, or clays so tenacious that
the surface bakes and cracks while still too wet within 3 or 4 inches
of the surface to operate with farm tools. These excluded, still leave
a very wide range of silt, clay, and loam soils, most of which are
suitable to cacao culture.</p>
<p>Where properly protected from the wind a rocky soil, otherwise good,
is not objectionable; in fact, such lands have the advantage of
promoting good drainage. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e344" href=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Preparation of the Soil.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the plantation is made upon forest lands, it is
necessary to cut and burn all underbrush, together with all timber
trees other than those designed for shade. If such shade trees are left
(and the advisability of leaving them will be discussed in the proper
place), only those of the pulse or bean family are to be recommended.
It should also be remembered that, owing in part to the close planting
of cacao and in part to the fragility of its wood and its great
susceptibility to damage resulting from wounds, subsequent removal of
large shade trees from the plantation is attended with difficulty and
expense, and the planter should leave few shade trees to the hectare.
Clearing the land should be done during the dry season, and refuse
burned in situ, thereby conserving to the soil the potash salts so
essential to the continued well-being of cacao.</p>
<p>The land should be deeply plowed, and, if possible, subsoiled as
well, and then, pending the time of planting the orchard, it may be
laid down to corn, cotton, beans, or some forage plant. Preference
should be given to &ldquo;hoed crops,&rdquo; as it is essential to keep
the surface in open tilth, as well as to destroy all weeds.</p>
<p>The common practice in most cacao-growing countries is to simply dig
deep holes where the trees are to stand, and to give a light working to
the rest of the surface just sufficient to produce the intermediate
crops. This custom is permissible only on slopes too steep for the
successful operation of a side hill plow, or where from lack of draft
animals all cultivation has to be done by hand.</p>
<p>Cacao roots deeply, and with relatively few superficial feeders, and
the deeper the soil is worked the better.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="drainage" class="div1 chapter"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#xd27e167">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Drainage.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The number and size of the drains will depend upon the
amount of rainfall, the contour of the land, and the natural absorbent
character of the soil. In no case should the ditches be less than 1
meter wide and 60 cm. deep, and if loose stones are at hand the sloping
sides may be laid with them, which will materially protect them from
washing by torrential rains.</p>
<p>These main drains should all be completed prior to planting.
Connecting laterals may be opened subsequently, as the necessities of
further drainage or future irrigation may demand; shallow furrows will
generally answer for these laterals, and as their obliteration will
practically follow every time cultivation is given, their construction
may be of the cheapest and most temporary nature. Owing to the
necessity of main drainage canals and the needful interplanting of
shade plants between the rows of cacao, nothing is gained by laying off
the land for planting in what is called &ldquo;two ways,&rdquo; and all
subsequent working of the orchard will consequently be in one
direction. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e363" href="#xd27e363"

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">The Plantation.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Cacao, relatively to the size of the tree, may be
planted very closely. We have stated that it rejoices in a close,
moisture-laden atmosphere, and this permits of a closer planting than
would be admissible with any other orchard crop.</p>
<p>In very rich soil the strong-growing Forastero variety may be
planted 3.7 meters apart each way, or 745 trees to the hectare, and on
lighter lands this, or the more dwarf-growing forms of Criollo, may be
set as close as 3 meters or rather more than 1,000 trees to the
hectare.</p>
<p>The rows should be very carefully lined out in one direction and
staked where the young plants are to be set, and then (a year before
the final planting) between each row of cacao a line of temporary
shelter plants are to be planted. These should be planted in quincunx
order, i. e., at the intersecting point of two lines drawn between the
diagonal corners of the square made by four cacaos set equidistant each
way. This temporary shelter is indispensable for the protection of the
young plantation from wind and sun.</p>
<p>The almost universal custom is to plant, for temporary shelter,
suckers of fruiting bananas, but throughout the Visayas and in Southern
Luzon I think abac&aacute; could be advantageously substituted. It is
true that, as commonly grown, abac&aacute; does not make so rank a
growth as some of the plantains, but if given the perfect tillage which
the cacao plantation should receive, and moderately rich soils,
abac&aacute; ought to furnish all necessary shade. This temporary shade
may be maintained till the fourth or fifth year, when it is to be
grubbed out and the stalks and stumps, which are rich in nitrogen, may
be left to decay upon the ground. At present prices, the four or five
crops which may be secured from the temporary shelter plants ought to
meet the expenses of the entire plantation until it comes into
bearing.</p>
<p>In the next step, every fourth tree in the fourth or fifth row of
cacao may be omitted and its place filled by a permanent shade tree.
The planting of shade trees or &ldquo;madre de cacao&rdquo; among the
cacao has been observed from time immemorial in all countries where the
crop is grown, and the primary purpose of the planting has been for
shade alone. Observing that these trees were almost invariably of the
pulse or legume family, the writer, in the year 1892, raised the
question, in the Proceedings of the Southern California Horticultural
Society, that the probable benefits derived were directly attributable
to the abundant fertilizing micro&ouml;rganisms developed in the soil
by these leguminous plants, rather than the <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e377" title="Source: mechancial">mechanical</span> protection they
afforded from the sun&rsquo;s rays.</p>
<p>To Mr. O. F. Cook, of the United States Department of Agriculture,
however, belongs the credit of publishing, in 1901,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e382src" href="#xd27e382" name="xd27e382src">1</a> a
r&eacute;sum&eacute; of his inquiries into the subject of the shades
used for both the coffee and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd27e385" href="#xd27e385" name="xd27e385">10</a>]</span>cacao, and
which fully confirmed the previous opinions that the main benefit
derived from these trees was their influence in maintaining a constant
supply of available nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>That cacao and its wild congenors naturally seek the shelter of
well-shaded forests is well established; but having seen trees in these
Islands that were fully exposed at all times showing no evidences of
either scald, burn, or sun spot, and in every respect the embodiment of
vigor and health, we are fully justified in assuming that here the
climatic conditions are such as will permit of taking some reasonable
liberties with this time-honored practice and supply needed nitrogen to
the soil by the use of cheap and effective &ldquo;catch crops,&rdquo;
such us cowpeas or soy beans.</p>
<p>Here, as elsewhere, an Erythrina, known as &ldquo;dap-dap,&rdquo; is
a favorite shade tree among native planters; the rain tree
(<i>Pithecolobium saman</i>) is also occasionally used, and in one
instance only have I seen a departure from the use of the
Leguminos&aelig;, and that in western Mindanao, there is a shade
plantation composed exclusively of <i>Cananga odorata</i>, locally
known as ilang-ilang.</p>
<p>While not yet prepared to advocate the total exclusion of all shade
trees, I am prepared to recommend a shade tree, if shade trees there
must be, whose utility and unquestioned value has singularly escaped
notice. The tree in question, the Royal <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e399" title="Source: Ponciana">Poinciana</span> (<i>Poinciana
regia</i>), embodies all of the virtues that are ascribed to the best
of the pulse family, is easily procured, grows freely and rapidly from
seed or cutting, furnishes a minimum of shade at all times, and, in
these Islands, becomes almost leafless, at the season of maturity of
the largest cacao crop when the greatest sun exposure is desired.</p>
<p>The remaining preparatory work consists in the planting of
intersecting wind breaks at intervals throughout the grove, and upon
sides exposed to winds, or where a natural forest growth does not
furnish such a shelter belt. Unless the plantation lies in a
particularly protected valley, no plantation, however large in the
aggregate, should cover more than 4 or 5 hectares unbroken by at least
one row of wind-break trees. Nothing that I know of can approach the
mango for this purpose. It will hold in check the fiercest gale and
give assurance to the grower that after any storm his cacao crop is
still on the trees and not on the ground, a prey to ants, mice, and
other vermin.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Selection of Varieties.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All the varieties of cacao in general cultivation may
be referred to three general types, the Criollo, Forastero, and
Calabacillo; and of these, those that I have met in cultivation in the
Archipelago are the first and second only. The Criollo is incomparably
the finest variety in general use, and may perhaps be most readily
distinguished by the inexperienced through the ripe but unfermented
seed or almond, as it is often called. This, on breaking, is found to
be whitish or yellowish-white, while the seeds of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd27e412" href="#xd27e412" name=
"xd27e412">11</a>]</span>those in which the Forastero or Calabacillo
blood predominates are reddish, or, in the case of Forastero, almost
violet in color. For flavor, freedom from bitterness, facility in
curing, and high commercial value, the Criollo is everywhere conceded
to be <i>facile princeps</i>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in point of yield, vigor, freedom from disease,
and compatibility to environment it is not to be compared with the
others. Nevertheless, where such perfect conditions exist as are found
in parts of Mindanao, I do not hesitate to urge the planting of
Criollo. Elsewhere, or wherever the plantation is tentative or the
conditions not very well known to the planter, the Forastero is to be
recommended. The former is commercially known as
&ldquo;<i>Caracas</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>old red Ceylon</i>,&rdquo;
and may be obtained from Ceylon dealers; and the latter, the Forastero,
or forms of it which have originated in the island, can be procured
from Java.</p>
<p>It seems not unlikely that the true Forastero may have been brought
to these Islands from Acapulco, Mexico, two hundred and thirty-two
years ago,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e427src" href="#xd27e427" name=
"xd27e427src">1</a> as it was at that time the dominant kind grown in
southeastern Mexico, and, if so, the place where the pure type would
most likely be found in these Islands would be in the Camarines,
Southern Luzon. Aside from the seed characters already given, Forastero
is recognized by its larger, thicker, more abundant, and rather more
abruptly pointed fruit than Criollo, and its coarse leaves which are
from 22 to 50 cm. long by 7 to 13 cm. wide, dimensions nearly double
those reached by the Criollo or Calabacillo varieties.</p>

to &ldquo;Historia de Filipinas,&rdquo; by P. Fr. Gaspar de S.

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Planting.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Planting may be done &ldquo;at stake&rdquo; or from
the nursery. For the unskilled or inexperienced planter, who has means
at hand to defray the greater cost, planting &ldquo;at stake&rdquo; is
perhaps to be recommended. This is no more than the dropping and
lightly covering, during the rainy season, of three or four seeds at
the stake where the plant is to stand, protecting the spot with a bit
of banana leaf, left till the seeds have sprouted, and subsequently
pulling out all but the one strongest and thriftiest plant.</p>
<p>The contingencies to be met by this system are many. The enemies of
the cacao seed are legion. Drought, birds, worms, ants, beetles, mice,
and rats will all contribute their quota to prevent a good
&ldquo;stand&rdquo; and entail the <span class="corr" id="xd27e437"
title="Source: necessitly">necessity</span> of repeated plantings.
Success by planting &ldquo;at stake&rdquo; is so doubtful that it is
rarely followed by experienced planters.</p>
<p>The consequent alternative lies in rearing seedlings in seed beds
that are under immediate control, and, when the plants are of
sufficient size, in transplanting them to their proper sites in the
orchard. In view of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e442" href=
"#xd27e442" name="xd27e442">12</a>]</span>remarkable short-lived
vitality of the cacao seed, it is in every way advisable that the
untrained grower procure his plants from professional nurserymen, or,
if this resource is lacking, that he import the young plants in Wardian
cases from some of the many firms abroad who make a specialty of
preparing them for foreign markets.</p>
<p>Both of these expedients failing, then it is advised that the seeds
be sown one by one in small pots, or, if these are not procurable, in
small bamboo tubes, and, for the sake of uniform moisture, plunge them
to their rims in any free, light soil in a well-shaded easily protected
spot where they may be carefully watered. In three to six months
(according to growth) the tube with its included plant may be planted
in the open field, when the former will speedily decompose and the
growth of the cacao proceed without check or injury.</p>
<p>At best, all of the above suggested methods are but crude expedients
to replace the more workmanlike, expeditious, and satisfactory process
of planting the conventional nursery grown stock. There is nothing more
difficult in the rearing of cacao seedlings than in growing any other
evergreen fruit tree. Briefly stated, it is only the finding of a
well-prepared, well-shaded seed bed and sowing the seeds in rows or
drills, and, when the seedlings are of proper size, in lifting and
transferring them to the plantation. But in actual practice there are
many details calling for the exercise of trained judgment from the
preparation of the seed bed down to the final process of
&ldquo;hardening off,&rdquo; concerning which the reader is referred to
the many available text-books on general nursery management.</p>
<p>It may be said for the benefit of those unable to adopt more
scientific methods: Let the seed bed be selected in a well-shaded spot,
and, if possible, upon a rather stiff, plastic, but well-drained soil.
After this is well broken up and made smooth, broadcast over all 3 or 4
inches of well-decomposed leaf mold mixed with sand, and in this sow
the seed in furrows about 1 inch deep. This sowing should be made
during the dry season, not only to avoid the beating and washing of
violent storms but to have the nursery plants of proper size for
planting at the opening of the rainy season. The seed bed should be
accessible to water, in order that it may be conveniently watered by
frequent sprinklings throughout the dry season.</p>
<p>The rich top dressing will stimulate the early growth of the
seedling, and when its roots enter the heavier soil below it will
encourage a stocky growth. Four or five months later the roots will be
so well established in the stiffer soil that if lifted carefully each
plant may be secured with a ball of earth about its roots, placed in a
tray or basket, and in this way carried intact to the field. Plants
thus reared give to the inexperienced an assurance of success not
always obtained by the trained or veteran planter of bare rooted
subjects. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e452" href="#xd27e452"

<h2 class="main">Cultivation.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Planters are united in the opinion that pruning,
cutting, or in any way lacerating the roots is injurious to the cacao,
and in deference to this opinion all cultivation close to the tree
should be done with a harrow-tooth cultivator, or shallow scarifier.
All intermediate cultivation should be deep and thorough, whenever the
mechanical condition of the soil will permit it. A plant stunted in
youth will never make a prolific tree; early and continuous growth can
only be secured by deep and thorough cultivation.</p>
<p>Of even more consideration than an occasional root cutting is any
injury, however small, to the tree stem, and on this account every
precaution should be taken to protect the trees from accidental injury
when plowing or cultivating. The whiffletree of the plow or cultivator
used should be carefully fendered with rubber or a soft woolen packing
that will effectually guard against the carelessness of workmen. Wounds
in the bark or stem offer an inviting field for the entry of insects or
the spores of fungi, and are, furthermore, apt to be overlooked until
the injury becomes deep seated and sometimes beyond repair.</p>
<p>With the gradual extension of root development, cultivation will be
reduced to a narrow strip between the rows once occupied by the
plantain or the abac&aacute;, but, to the very last, the maintenance of
the proper soil conditions should be observed by at least one good
annual plowing and by as many superficial cultivations as the growth of
the trees and the mechanical state of the land will admit.</p>

<div id="pruning" class="div1 chapter"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Pruning.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When left to its own resources the cacao will fruit
for an almost indefinite time. When well and strenuously grown it will
bear much more abundant fruit from its fifth to its twenty-fifth year,
and by a simple process of renewal can be made productive for a much
longer time.</p>
<p>A necessary factor to this result is an annual pruning upon strictly
scientific lines. The underlying principle involved is, primarily, the
fact that the cacao bears its crop directly upon the main branches and
trunk, and not upon spurs or twigs; secondly, that wood under three
years is rarely fruitful, and that only upon stems or branches of five
years or upward does the maximum fruitfulness occur; that the seat of
inflorescence is directly over the axil of a fallen leaf, from whence
the flowers are born at irregular times throughout the year.</p>
<p>With this necessary, fundamental information as a basis of
operations, the rational system of pruning that suggests itself is the
maintenance of as large an extension at all times of straight,
well-grown mature wood and the perfecting of that by the early and
frequent removal of all limbs or branches that the form of the tree
does not admit of carrying without overcrowding. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd27e471" href="#xd27e471" name=
"xd27e471">14</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is desirable that this extension of the branch system should be
lateral rather than vertical, for the greater facility with which fruit
may be plucked and possible insect enemies fought; and on this account
the leading growths should be stopped when a convenient height has been
attained.</p>
<p>When well grown and without accident to its leader, the cacao will
naturally branch at from 1 to 1.4 meters from the ground. These primary
branches are mostly three to five in number, and all in excess of three
should be removed as soon as selection can be made of three strongest
that are as nearly equidistant from each other as may be. When these
branches are from 80 cm. to 1 meter long, and preferably the shorter
distance, they are to be stopped by pinching the extremities. This will
cause them and the main stem as well to &ldquo;break,&rdquo; i. e., to
branch in many places.</p>
<p>At this point the vigilance and judgment of the planter are called
into greater play. These secondary branches are, in turn, all to be
reduced as were the primary ones, and their selection can not be made
in a symmetrical whorl, for the habit of the tree does not admit of it,
and selection of the three should be made with reference to their
future extension, that the interior of the tree should not be
overcrowded and that such outer branches be retained as shall fairly
maintain the equilibrium of the crown.</p>
<p>This will complete the third year and the formative stage of the
plant. Subsequent prunings will be conducted on the same lines, with
the modification that when the secondary branches are again cut back,
the room in the head of the tree will rarely admit of more than one, at
most two, tertiary branches being allowed to remain. When these are
grown to an extent that brings the total height of the tree to 3 or 4
meters, they should be cut back annually, at the close of the dry
season. Such minor operations as the removal of thin, wiry, or
hide-bound growths and all suckers suggest themselves to every
horticulturist, whether he be experienced in cacao growing or not. When
a tree is exhausted by overbearing, or has originally been so ill
formed that it is not productive, a strong sucker or
&ldquo;gourmand&rdquo; springing from near the ground may be encouraged
to grow. By distributing the pruning over two or three periods, in one
year the old tree can be entirely removed and its place substituted by
the &ldquo;gourmand.&rdquo; During the third year flowers will be
abundant and some fruit will set, but it is advisable to remove it
while small and permit all of the energy of the plant to be expended in
wood making.</p>

interesting, fruit bearing habit of the Cacao.</p>
</div>
<p>From what we know of its flowering habit, it is obvious that every
operation connected with the handling or pruning of a cacao, should be
conducted with extreme care; to see that the bark is never injured
about the old leaf scars, for to just the extent it is so injured is
the fruit-bearing area curtailed. Further, no pruning cut should ever
be inflicted, except with the sharpest of knives and saws, and the use
of shears, that always <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e489" href=
"#xd27e489" name="xd27e489">15</a>]</span>bruise to <i>some</i> extent,
is to be avoided. All the rules that are laid down for the guidance of
the pruning of most orchard trees in regard to clean cuts, sloping
cuts, and the covering of large wounds with tar or resin apply with
fourfold force to the cacao. Its wood is remarkably spongy and an easy
prey to the enemies ever lying in wait to attack it, and the surest
remedies for disease are preventive ones, and by the maintenance
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e494" href="#xd27e494" name=
"xd27e494">16</a>]</span>of the bark of the tree at all times in the
sound condition, we are assured that it is best qualified to resist
invasion. Of the great number of worm-riddled trees to be seen in the
Archipelago, it is easy in every case to trace the cause to the neglect
and brutal treatment which left them in a condition to invite the
attacks of disease of every kind.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Harvest.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The ripening period of cacao generally occurs at two
seasons of the year, but in these islands the most abundant crop is
obtained at about the commencement of the dry season, and the fruits
continue to ripen for two months or longer. The time of its approaching
maturity is easily recognized by the tyro by the unmistakable aroma of
chocolate that pervades the orchard at that period, and by some of the
pods turning reddish or yellow according to the variety.</p>
<p>The pods are attached by a very short stalk to the trunk of the
tree, and those within reach of the hand are carefully cut with shears.
Those higher up are most safely removed with an extension American tree
pruner. A West Indian hook knife with a cutting edge above and below
and mounted on a bamboo pole, if kept with the edges very sharp, does
excellently well, but should only be intrusted to the most careful
workmen. There is hardly a conceivable contingency to warrant the
climbing of a cacao tree. If it should occur, the person climbing
should go barefooted. As soon as the fruit, or so much of it as is well
ripened, has been gathered, it is thrown into heaps and should be
opened within twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>The opening is done in a variety of ways, but the practice followed
in Surinam would be an excellent one here if experienced labor was not
at command. There, with a heavy knife or cutlass (bolo), they cut off
the base or stem end of the fruit and thereby expose the column to
which the seeds are attached, and then women and children, who free
most of the seeds, are able to draw out the entire seed mass intact. It
is exceedingly important that the seeds are not wounded, and for that
reason it is inexpedient to intrust the more expeditious method of
halving the fruit with a sharp knife to any but experienced
workmen.</p>
<p>The process of curing that I have seen followed in these Islands is
simplicity itself. Two jars half filled with water are provided for the
cleaners, and as the seeds are detached from the pulp they are sorted
and graded on the spot. Only those of large, uniform size, well formed
and thoroughly ripe, being thrown into one; deformed, small, and
imperfectly matured seeds going to the other. In these jars the seeds
are allowed to stand in their own juice for a day, then they are taken
out, washed in fresh water, dried in the sun from two to four days,
according to the weather, and the process from the Filipino standpoint
is complete.</p>
<p>Much of the product thus obtained is singularly free from bitterness
and of such excellent quality; as to be saleable at unusually high
prices, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e510" href="#xd27e510" name=
"xd27e510">17</a>]</span>and at the same time in such good demand that
it is with some hesitancy that the process of fermentation is
recommended for general use.</p>
<p>But it is also equally certain that localities in these Islands will
be planted to cacao where all the conditions that help to turn out an
unrivaled natural product are by no means assured. For such places,
where the rank-growing, more coarse-flavored, and bitter-fruited
Forastero may produce exceptionally good crops, it will become
incumbent on the planter to adopt some of the many methods of
fermentation, whereby he can correct the crudeness of the untreated
bean and receive a remunerative price for the &ldquo;processed&rdquo;
or ameliorated product.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the Strickland method, or some modification of it, is
the best, and is now in general use on all considerable estates where
the harvest is 200 piculs or upward per annum, and its use probably
assures a more uniform product than any of the ruder processes in
common use by small proprietors.</p>
<p>But it must not be forgotten that the present planters in the
Philippines are all small proprietors, and that until such time as the
maturing of large plantations calls for the more elaborate apparatus of
the Strickland pattern, some practice whereby the inferior crude bean
may be economically and quickly converted into a marketable product can
not be avoided. As simple and efficacious as any is that largely
pursued in some parts of Venezuela, where is produced the famous
Caracas cacao.</p>
<p>The beans and pulp are thrown into wooden vats that are pierced with
holes sufficient to permit of the escape of the juice, for which
twenty-four hours suffices. The vat is then exposed to the sun for five
or six hours, and the beans, while still hot, are taken out, thrown
into large heaps, and covered with blankets.</p>
<p>The next day they are returned to the box, subjected to a strong sun
heat and again returned to the heap. This operation is repeated for
<span class="corr" id="xd27e522" title="Source: sevral">several</span>
days, until the beans, by their bright chocolate color and suppleness,
indicate that they are cured. If, during the period of fermentation,
rain is threatened or occurs, the beans are shoveled, still hot, into
bags and retained there until they can once more be exposed to the sun.
Before the final bagging they are carefully hand rubbed in order to
remove the adherent gums and fibrous matters that did not pass off in
the primary fermentation.</p>
<p>In Ceylon, immediately after the beans have been fermented they are
washed, and the universally high prices obtained by the Ceylon planters
make it desirable to reproduce here a brief r&eacute;sum&eacute; of
their method. The fermentation is carried on under sheds, and the beans
are heaped up in beds of 60 cm. to 1 meter in thickness upon a platform
of parallel joists arranged to permit of the escape of the juices. This
platform is elevated from the ground and the whole heap is covered with
sacks or matting. The fermentation takes from five to seven days,
according to the heat of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e528" href=
"#xd27e528" name="xd27e528">18</a>]</span>the atmosphere and the size
of the heap, and whenever the temperature rises above 40&deg; the mass
is carefully turned over with wooden shovels.</p>
<p>Immediately after the fermentation is completed the Ceylon planter
passes the mass through repeated washings, and nothing remains but to
dry the seed. This in Ceylon is very extensively done, in dryers of
different kinds, some patterned after the American fruit dryer, some in
slowly rotating cylinders through the axis of which a powerful blast of
hot air is driven.</p>
<p>The process of washing unquestionably diminishes somewhat the weight
of the cured bean; for that reason the practice is not generally
followed in other countries, but in the case of the Ceylon product it
is one of the contributing factors to the high prices obtained.</p>

<h2 class="main">Enemies and Diseases.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Monkeys, rats, and parrots are here and in all
tropical countries the subject of much complaint, and if the plantation
is remote from towns or in the forest, their depredations can only be
held in check by the constant presence of well-armed hunter or
watchman. Of the more serious enemies with which we have to deal,
pernicious insects and in particular those that attack the wood of the
tree, everything has yet to be learned.</p>
<p>Mr. Charles N. Banks, an accomplished entomologist, now stationed at
Maao, Occidental Negros, is making a close study of the life history of
the insect enemies of cacao, and through his researches it is hoped
that much light will be thrown upon the whole subject and that ways
will be devised to overcome and prevent the depredations of these
insect pests. The most formidable insect that has so far been
encountered is a beetle, which pierces and deposits its eggs within the
bark. When the worm hatches, it enters the wood and traverses it
longitudinally until it is ready to assume the mature or beetle state,
when it comes to the surface and makes its escape. These worms will
frequently riddle an entire branch and even enter the trunk. The
apertures that the beetle makes for the laying of its eggs are so
small&mdash;more minute than the head of a pin&mdash;that discovery and
probing for the worm with a fine wire is not as fruitful of results as
has been claimed.</p>
<p>Of one thing, however, we are positively assured, i. e., that the
epoch of ripening of the cacao fruit is the time when its powerful
fragrance serves to attract the greatest number of these beetles and
many other noxious insects to the grove. This, too, is the time when
the most constant and abundant supply of labor is on the plantation and
when vast numbers of these insects can be caught and destroyed. The
building of small fires at night in the groves, as commonly practiced
here and in many tropical countries, is attended with some benefits.
Lately, in India, this remedy has been subject to an improvement that
gives promise of results which will in time minimize the ravages of
insect pests. It is in placing powerful acetylene lights over broad,
shallow vats of water overlaid with mineral <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd27e543" href="#xd27e543" name=
"xd27e543">19</a>]</span>oil or petroleum. Some of these lamps now made
under recent patents yield a light of dazzling brilliancy, and if well
distributed would doubtless lure millions of insects to their death.
The cheap cost of the fuel also makes the remedy available for trial by
every planter.</p>
<p>There is a small hemipterous insect which stings the fruit when
about two-thirds grown, and deposits its eggs within. For this class of
insects M. A. Tonduz, who has issued publications on the diseases of
cacao in Venezuela, recommends washing the fruit with salt water, and
against the attacks of beetles in general by painting the tree stem and
branches with Bordeaux mixture, or with the vassili&eacute;re
insecticide, of which the basis is a combination of whale-oil soap and
petroleum suspended in lime wash. There can be no possible virtue in
the former, except as a preventive against possible fungous diseases;
of the sanitive value of the latter we can also afford to be skeptical,
as the mechanical sealing of the borer&rsquo;s holes, and thereby
cutting off the air supply, would only result in driving the worm
sooner to the surface. The odor of petroleum and particularly of
whale-oil soap is so <span class="corr" id="xd27e547" title=
"Source: repellant">repellent</span>, however, to most insects that its
prophylactic virtues would undoubtedly be great.</p>
<p>The Philippine Islands appear to be so far singularly exempt from
the very many cryptogamic or fungous diseases, blights, mildews, rusts,
and cankers that have played havoc with cacao-growing in many
countries. That we should enjoy continued immunity will depend greatly
upon securing seeds or young plants only from noninfested districts or
from reputable dealers, who will carefully disinfect any shipments, and
to supplement this by a close microscopical examination upon arrival
and the immediate burning of any suspected shipments.</p>
<p>Another general precaution that will be taken by every planter who
aims to maintain the best condition in his orchard is the gathering and
burning of all prunings or trimmings from the orchard, whether they are
diseased or not. Decaying wood of any kind is a field for special
activity for insect life and fungous growth, and the sooner it is
destroyed the better.</p>
<p>On this account it is customary in some countries to remove the
fruit pods from the field. But unless diseased, or unless they are to
be returned after the harvest, they should be buried upon the land for
their manurial value.</p>

<div id="manuring" class="div1 chapter"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Manuring.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are few cultivated crops that make less drain
upon soil fertility than cacao, and few drafts upon the land are so
easily and inexpensively returned. From an examination made of detailed
analyses by many authors and covering many regions, it may be broadly
stated that an average crop of cacao in the most-favored districts is
about 9 piculs per hectare, and that of the three all-important
elements of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, a total of slightly
more than 4.2 kilograms is removed in each <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd27e561" href="#xd27e561" name=
"xd27e561">20</a>]</span>picul of cured seeds harvested. These 37 kilos
of plant food that are annually taken from each hectare may be roughly
subdivided as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>18 kilos of nitrogen,</li>
<li>10 kilos of potash,</li>
<li>9 kilos of phosphoric acid.</li>
</ul>
<p>On this basis, after the plantation is in full bearing, we would
have to make good with standard fertilizers each year for each hectare
about 220 kilos of nitrate of soda, or, if the plantation was shaded
with leguminous trees, only one-half that amount, or 110 kilos. Of
potash salts, say the sulphate, only one-half that amount, or 55 kilos,
if the plantation was unshaded. If, however, it was shaded, as the
leguminous trees are all heavy feeders of potash, we would have to
double the amount and use 110 kilos.</p>
<p>In any case, as fixed nitrogen always represents a cost quite double
that of potash, from an economical standpoint the planter is still the
gainer who supplies potash to the shade trees. There still remains
phosphoric acid, which, in the form of the best superphosphate of lime,
would require 55 kilos for unshaded orchards, and about 70 if dap-dap,
Pionciana, or any leguminous tree was grown in the orchard. These three
ingredients may be thoroughly incorporated and used as a top dressing
and lightly harrowed in about each tree.</p>
<p>If the commercial nitrates can not be readily obtained, then
recourse must be had to the sparing use of farm manures. Until the
bearing age these may be used freely, but after that with caution and
discrimination. Although I have seen trees here that have been bearing
continuously for twenty-two years, I have been unable to find so much
as one that to the knowledge of the oldest resident has ever been
fertilized in any way, yet, notwithstanding our lack of knowledge of
local conditions, it seems perfectly safe to predicate that liberal
manuring with stable manure or highly ammoniated fertilizers would
insure a rank, succulent growth that is always prejudicial to the best
and heaviest fruit production. In this I am opposed to Professor
Hart,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e577src" href="#xd27e577" name=
"xd27e577src">1</a> who seems to think that stable manures are those
only that may be used with a free hand.</p>
<p>We have many safe ways of applying nitrogen through the medium of
various catch crops of pulse or beans, with the certainty that we can
never overload the soil with more than the adjacent tree roots can take
up and thoroughly assimilate. When the time comes that the orchard so
shades the ground that crops can no longer be grown between the rows,
then, in preference to stable manures I would recommend cotton-seed
cake or &ldquo;poonac,&rdquo; the latter being always obtainable in
this Archipelago.</p>
<p>While the most desirable form in which potash can be applied is in
the form of the sulphate, excellent results have been had with the use
of Kainit or Stassfurth salts, and as a still more available
substitute, wood ashes is suggested. When forest lands are near, the
underbrush may be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e584" href=
"#xd27e584" name="xd27e584">21</a>]</span>cut and burned in a clearing
or wherever it may be done without detriment to the standing timber,
and the ashes scattered in the orchard before they have been leached by
rains. The remaining essential of phosphoric acid in the form of
superphosphates will for some years to come necessarily be the subject
of direct importation. In the cheap form of phosphate slag it is
reported to have been used with great success in both Grenada and
British Guiana, and would be well worthy of trial here.</p>
<p>Lands very rich in humus, as some of our forest valleys are,
undoubtedly carry ample nitrogenous elements of fertility to maintain
the trees at a high standard of growth for many years, but provision is
indispensable for a regular supply of potash and phosphoric acid as
soon as the trees come into heavy bearing. It is to them and not to the
nitrogen that we look for the formation of strong, stocky, well-ripened
wood capable of fruit bearing and for fruit that shall be sound, highly
flavored, and well matured.</p>
<p>The bearing life of such a tree will surely be healthfully prolonged
for many years beyond one constantly driven with highly stimulating
foods, and in the end amply repay the grower for the vigilance, toil,
and original expenditure of money necessary to maintaining a well-grown
and well-appointed cacao plantation.</p>

exclusively grown from seed, and it is only by careful selection of the
most valuable trees that the planter can hope to make the most
profitable renewals or additions to his plantations. It is by this

regions that have continued to vary from the three original, common

to the planter of cacao. The climate as a whole is remarkably
salubrious, and sites are to be found nearly everywhere for the estate

near stagnant waters.</p>
<p>Malarial fevers are relatively few, predacious animals unknown, and
insects and reptiles prejudicial to human life or health
extraordinarily few in number. In contrast to this we need only call
attention to the entire Caribbean coast of South America, where the
climate and soil conditions are such that the cacao comes to a
superlative degree of perfection, and yet the limits of its further
extension have probably been reached by the insuperable barrier of a
climate so insalubrious that the Caucasian&rsquo;s life is one endless
conflict with disease, and when not engaged in active combat with some
form of malarial poisoning his energies are concentrated upon battle
with the various insect or animal pests that make life a burden in such

<p>In the tenth year there should be no increase in taxes or
fertilizers, and a slight increase in yield, sufficient to bring the
net profits of the estate to the approximate amount of $5,000. This
would amount to a dividend of rather more than $312 per hectare, or its
equivalent of about $126 per acre.</p>
<p>These tables further show original capitalization cost of nearly $90
per acre, and from the ninth year annual operating expenses of rather
more than $60 per acre.</p>
<p>It should be stated, however, that the operating expenses are based
upon a systematic and scientific management of the estate; while the
returns or income are based upon revenue from trees that are at the
disadvantage of being without culture of any kind, and, while I am of
the opinion that the original cost per acre of the plantation, nor its
current operating expenses may be much reduced below the figures given,
I feel that there is a reasonable certainty that the crop product may
be materially increased beyond the limit of two
&ldquo;catties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Camerouns, Dr. Preuss, a close and well-trained observer, gives
the mean annual yield of trees of full-bearing age at 4.4 pounds.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e1275" href="#xd27e1275" name=
"xd27e1275">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>Mr. Rousselot places the yield on the French Congo at the same
figure<span class="corr" id="xd27e1278" title="Not in source">.</span>
In the Caroline Islands it reaches 5 pounds and in Surinam, according
to M. Nichols, the average at maturity is 6&frac12; pounds. In
Mindanao, I have been told, but do not vouch for the report, of more
than ten &ldquo;catties&rdquo; taken in one year from a single tree;
and, as there are well-authenticated instances of record, of single
trees having yielded as much as 30 pounds, I am not prepared to
altogether discredit the Mindanao story.</p>
<p>The difference, however, between good returns and enormous profits
arising from cacao growing in the Philippines will be determined by the
amount of knowledge, experience, and energy that the planter is capable
of bringing to bear upon the culture in question.</p>
